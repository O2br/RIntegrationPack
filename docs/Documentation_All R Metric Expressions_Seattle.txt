Economy Factor (for "Data Creation" Step 91/92):

*** "STANDARD" ***
Uses the default "RScripts" folder for any files generated.
If user does not have proper access rights to the "RScripts" folder, see "USER-SPECIFIC" section below.

NOTE:  The default "RScripts" folder is the primary repository for storing and locating R Scripts. It is created when the R Integration Pack is installed.  During installation, the folder was populated with all the "Off-the-Shelf" R Scripts (and in particular the R Scripts required by the workshop).  Because we'll be writing to this installation directory, users must have proper permisssions in the Access Control List (ACL) that governs the security for this folder.  Unfortunately, non-administrator users who selected the defaults for R Integration Pack installation may be restricted in writing to the "RScripts" folder. 
  NOTE:  The "RScripts" folder can be found when the R Integration Pack was installed 
           Typical for Windows:        C:\Program Files (x86)\R Integration Pack\RScripts 
           Typical for 64-bit Windows: C:\Program Files)\R Integration Pack\RScripts"

*** "USER SPECIFIC" ***

Uses the user's download folder (same location most systems use by default when downloading content from the internet, therefore the users must have sufficient permissions to write to that folder).  The main difference from above is that the metric expressions below specify a different working directory than the default RScripts folder.

           Typical for Windows:        \Users\<yourusername>\Downloads
[HINT:  Edit this document and globally replace all instances of "<yourusername>" with your user name (e.g., "jane.doe"); then the expression below will be ready to go for that user.]
